This directory includes a sample DIRECTED.TXT file as well as a sample
CSV file for loading into YAAC.

Run your own sample with the following command line from the
~/jsmapper/ directory (any callsign will work for the sample data):

./jsmapper.rb --mycall n0clu --dial-freq 7120 --in-file sample/DIRECTED.TXT

This will produce an ammron.csv file in your current directory,
suitable for loading into YAAC.
